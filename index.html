      <h2>more about me</h2>
      <p>going into college the degree of my pursuit was economics
        at the university of alabama, it wasn't until my semester abroad in london
        during junior year that the switch to computer science ocurred. <br> <br>
        it occurred to me that my lifelong obsession with tech could actually
        be a career, and from that moment my mind was made up.<br><br>
        as a youth, much of my time was spent in scouting, the outdoors have always
        been a refuge for me and this organization taught me more about what it
        means to be a leader. <br><br>
        part of being a scout means you follow the scout law, this involves 
        certain virtues that are important to me, these include being trustworthy, loyal,
        helpful, friendly, curteous, kind, obediant, cheerful, thrifty, and brave <br><br>
        adding me to your team means you are gaining someone who has these values and strives 
        to become a better individual every day
